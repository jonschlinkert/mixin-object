> Mixin the own and inherited properties of other objects onto the first object. Pass an empty object as the first arg to shallow clone.

Follow this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), for updates on this project and others.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save mixin-object
```

If you only want to combine own-properties, use [extend-shallow](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/extend-shallow).

## Usage

```js
var mixin = require('mixin-object');

var obj = {c: 'c'};
var foo = mixin(obj, {a: 'a'}, {b: 'b'});
console.log(foo);
//=> {c: 'c', a: 'a', b: 'b'}
console.log(obj);
//=> {c: 'c'}

mixin({}, {a: 'a'}, {b: 'b'});
//=> {a: 'a', b: 'b'}
```
